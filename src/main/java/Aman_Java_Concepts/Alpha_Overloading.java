/*Definition of final:
The final keyword means that once we assign a value, we cannot change it later

Purpose of final:
We use final keyword to make a variable constant, prevent a method from being overridden, or stop a class from being inherited.

Easy examples to imagine:
Final variable: Once you give a value, you can't change it or update it . (Like your birthdate â€” it never changes.)
Final method: No one can modify its behavior in child classes.
Final class: No one can make a subclass (child class) from it.*/
